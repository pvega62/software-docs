Even if lying is the way to save your own life, or any life, you absolutely can't lie."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This isn\u2019t the first time Captain America has stood against the government he is supposed to represent. In the 1970s Steve Rogers abandoned the Captain America identity and became Nomad after a government figure heavily implied to be Richard Nixon was found to be in charge of the Secret Empire, a subsidiary of Hydra. Hydra is basically Nazis but instead of a Cap quit again in the 80s when he once again became disillusioned with the American government who decided that because he was frozen at the end of World War II, Captain Rogers was still a technically an active member of the US Army and needed to operate as a regular soldier in the US Army. After the events that led to him adopting the Nomad identity, Rogers decided that he can no longer follow orders like a soldier and hands in the Captain America moniker and shield to John Walker and dons a black version of his costume with a matching shield and runs around as just the Captain. Eventually Rogers returns to the role again, having learned his lesson, again."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This commitment to embodying the Captain America spirit falls in line with Ross\u2019s idea of Pluralistic Deontology, which states that there are \u201c\u2026seven prima facie duties which need to be taken into consideration when deciding which duty should be acted upon.\u201d (Mastlin, 2008) One of them is the Duty of Beneficence, which is to help others improve their character. Both times Rogers stepped away from the mantle, he realizes that he is more useful as Captain America, serving as the living embodiment of all the goodness America is supposed to embody itself. Across the interdimensional pond at DC Comics, Superman serves that same purpose. It\u2019s even in his (recently amended) catchphrase, \u201cI fight for truth, justice and the American Way\u201d (Reeve, 1978) Another superhero who has Kantian Deontology thrust upon them but doesn't behave in such a manner."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let\u2019s go back to a major staple of Kantian Deontology, and the most argumentative, a Deontologist can't lie, under any circumstances. But both Captain America and Superman are inherent lies. Up until 2002, Steve Rogers was the secret identity of Captain America. A way for him to live the life he couldn\u2019t live if he was Captain America 24/7, he pursues an art career, something he loved before he became a Super Soldier and even works for Marvel Comics drawing Captain America comics (Comic Book logic isn't really all that logistical). When Superman isn\u2019t off bench-pressing planets or sneezing entire solar systems away, he\u2019s lounging around the Daily Planet newsroom as Clark Kent. If these two lived up to the deontological standards the other have set up for them, then they would live full time as one identity. Superman constantly lies to everyone who is not aware about who is, about who he is. The constant rationale behind a secret identity is that it\u2019s necessary to protect who they are so the enemies don\u2019t attack their loved ones. The SRA takes away that option. The government says that they will not release the information to the public but in the Marvel Universe, you can probably throw a stone at a crowd and hit someone who can hack a government database."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"By the time the SRA was enacted, Steve Rogers had outed himself as Captain America in response to 9/11. But that doesn\u2019t stop him from rallying and fighting for those with secret identities. This fulfills the \u201cDuty of Justice\u201d which states that one has a duty to fight for what one deserves, and Captain America believes that masked heroes deserve the respite a secret identity provides, after all these are people who have saved the world multiple times over. They deserve a slice of life that isn\u2019t filled punching people/aliens/wizards in the face. It also fulfills the \u201cDuty of Gratitude\u201d he\u2019s fighting for the benefit of people who have benefited him before, a lot of the superhero community has come to the assistance of Captain America when he\u2019s needed them."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It\u2019s been shown that fictional or not, sometimes the American government doesn\u2019t act in the best interest of the people. The Avengers fight crime all over the globe, they aren\u2019t like Daredevil who focuses on Hell\u2019s Kitchen, the Avengers aren\u2019t burdened by borders and even fight across dimensions and in outer space. In Captain America: Civil War, the theatrical adaptation of the Civil War arc, Captain America also refuses to go along with the Sokovia Accords, the movie version of the SRA. It states that the Avengers and any other superhumans, are to be registered with the United Nations and can only act when the UN deems it worthy for them to act. Captain America responds to Stark\u2019s suggestion to sign the accords with, \u201cIf we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there's somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.\u201d (Evans, 2016)"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In both version of Civil War, Captain America is worried more about what is right, more than what is good. He\u2019s willing to overlook how the idea of Captain America might be perceived by the rest of the population and to his peers that side with Stark. In the original event, Captain America waivers after he sees the destruction the battles have caused. Fulfilling the \u201cDuty of Reparation\u201d, he surrenders to Stark and the American government. Even here Captain America still believes that what he is doing is correct, but he is standing down to protect the lives of the citizens who are being caught in the reckless crossfire of those who swore to protect them. He is essentially standing down in the name of \u201cDuty of Non-Maleficence\u201d At the end of the day, Captain America yielded in the face of the greatest duty a soldier can have, protection of the innocent.

People who have laid their lives on the line for Stark time and time again.

That narcissistic streak is what prohibits him from seeing the enactment from a perspective that is not his, because Tony Stark can never be wrong.

He only lets Bruce Banner into the project near its completion, by the time Ultron goes online it\u2019s too late and the sentient AI goes insane and destroys the country of Sokovia in its final battle against the Avengers, leading to the Sokovia Accords in Captain America: Civil War."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"opposites-attract",children:"Opposites Attract"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Utilitarianism is used to justify the greatest good of the people over the good of the individual, or a small section of the population. That is what led to all the horrendous decisions that Stark makes during the original Civil War, starting with the creation of Ragnarok, a clone of Thor (who was away in Asgard and did not participate in the event). Because Asgardian DNA is unstable, Ragnarok goes berserk during a clash between the Pro-Registration and Anti-Registration, he causes the death of Goliath, a member of Captain America\u2019s team. The first major casualty on either side of the conflict."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This visibly rattles both sides of the argument and causes an exodus on Stark\u2019s side. Most notably is Spider-Man, who flees Avengers Towers with his aunt May and Mary-Jane in tow.

So how come something so just feels so wrong?\u201d (Straczynski, 2006) This is the Utilitarianism and the Deontologist in Peter Parker struggling in a situation where both sides are at odds. The part of him that wants to be a hero, that idolizes Captain America, that is essentially Spider-Man, wants to fight with Captain America, but there\u2019s also scientist Peter Parker, who admires all that Tony Stark and Stark Industries has accomplished in the name of science."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Once he sees the murder of Goliath, he defects. The Kingpin uses this opportunity to place a hit on Peter and his family. The hitman succeeds on shooting his aunt May. This leads to Peter breaking into the prison where Kingpin is being held at and proceeds to beat him to within an inch of life, promising that if May Parker dies, the Kingpin dies. This breaks away from both Utilitarianism and Deontology.

For his aunt to live, Peter must give up his marriage to Mary Jane Watson-Parker. They must live like they were never married, and the world will never remember the marriage and the fact that Peter Parker ever went public as Spider-Man. After much consternation, Peter accepts the offer. That is Peter\u2019s utilitarianism at work because the ends (the resurrection of May) justified the means (A deal with the devil). However, one can also argue that it was Deontology at work because of Ross\u2019s Pluralistic Deontology, which included \u201cDuty of Gratitude\u201d, May Parker took Peter in after his parents died at the age of five, as far as Peter Parker is concerned May is his mom and bringing her back to life would be a token of appreciation for all the love and support she\u2019s placed in him over the years, even when she found out he was Spider-Man, after years of initially voicing disdain for Spider-Man she became Spidey\u2019s #1 fan because that was her boy under the mask.
